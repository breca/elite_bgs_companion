# BGS Companion for Elite: Dangerous

![Example build](https://i.imgur.com/cpI2vzF.jpg)

## Current Version: 0.81a

This application parses the player's journal file and extracts
information that pertains to the Elite Dangerous background simulation.

### Current feature list
* Tracking of (most) BGS related data generated by the player. This includes a set of logic to determine whether your actions have any effect given the current state of the system. i.e Cashing out Combat bonds in a system that is hosting Elections will not change influence and subsequently will not be recorded.
	
* Captures all types of transactions and collates it into a simple format where it can be easily pasted to Discord. For trading and smuggling, items traded are also captured and are also subject to the same logic checks. Starving people don't care about your Palladium.

* In addition to it's core function, the Companion also features a contextual advisor giving advice on what/what not to do given the current system state to increase your chosen factions influence or increase/decrease the system state. i.e If a system is having an Election, it'll tell you not to bother dropping your bounties there.

* It's got some clocks.

### Usage:

No configuration is required, just fire it up. When you're done playing,
or whenever you want, view your BGS stats, paste them into Discord and
then clear your data via the 'Clear and Exit' button.

### How it works:

The Companion app's primary function is to scrape and collate BGS data,
but it does some other stuff too.

Apart from providing some basic information about your status, this
application is mostly dormant until it detects that you have done some
sort of action that effects system influence - be it cashing combat
bonds, bounties, profitable trading, completing missions, donations,
etc. It then records that information into a database. It mashes all
this together so you can then bring up a report of all your data,
showing how much you raised, where and who for - and with a simple click
of a button, copies that data to your clipboard where it can be pasted
into the relevant Discord channel.

Your Elite Dangerous client automatically writes logs to
C:\Users\<yourname>\Saved Games\Frontier Developments\Elite Dangerous
When you first load the application it finds the NEWEST log there and
parses the entire thing. If you close it, it will remember where it
left off and keep collect data from the same journal, or if it detects
a new one, it will start parsing that.

## DISCLAIMER + TINFOIL NOTE

There is no authentication taking place here, this is all local. 
Block the application in your firewall if you're feeling paranoid.
Only data currently transmitted is for checking for updates.
All that being said, use at your own risk, if this turns your PC into
molten slag, deletes all your cherished family photos, gives you brain
damage or makes you insult your grandmother, that's on you.

## Changelog:

 * Version 0.81a
	 Hotfix for lack of copy/paste and other issues brought about by
	 sloppy code refactoring and sleep deprivation.
	 Attempted to fix update check from blocking. Not there yet. :(
	 Improved location parsing.

 * Version 0.8a
	 Additional exception handling around database backend.
	 Changed journal parsing behaviour - the application now remembers
	 it's position in the journal and will resume where it left off -
	 until it detects a new journal file, when it'll just use that
	 instead.
	 Journal position and other stats are now inserted into the database
	 on exit.
	 Added version checker.

 * Version 0.7a
	 Fixes for missing exploration/trade/smuggling faction data.
	 Fixed ugly database call that potentially causes loss of
	 BGS data (Thanks Yojimbosan!).

 * Version 0.6a
  	 Cleaned up windows, added credits, added config file, modified
	 logging behaviour.

 * Version 0.5a - Here be dragons
	 Bugfixes maybe

 * Version 0.4a
 	 Tweaks to bounty/combat bond processing - now better reflects which
	 faction you're helping

 * Version 0.3a
	 Trade now determines whether you made a profit or not and reports
	 that info to the user in realtime.
	 In addition to the normal BGS logic set, trade and smuggling are
	 now only recorded if a profit is made (and only the net profit
	 is added to the report).

 * Version 0.2a
	 Reimplemented missions. It's really hacky but it seems to work.
	 Whatever. Missions now track where you picked them up from (and
	 who) and adjusts BGS stats accordingly.
	 Reformatted BGS stats page to better represent who/what you're
	 looking at.
	 Now captures BGS data for other factions besides RSC.

 * Version 0.1a
