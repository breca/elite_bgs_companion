# Text used for BGS advisor
# In systems where your faction has a presence, you will see 'defence' strings displayed
# in the app. The string is a suffix to your faction (defined in bgs.yml)
# i.e Radio Sidewinder is in famine, blah blah.
#
# Offensive strings in foreign systems are a bit different.
# If there is an ENEMY faction (defined in bgs.yml) then it will be presented first (even if it isn't in a state).
# If there are no enemies, it will advise on the owning faction. If they're not in a state, the next
# largest faction is used. Again, the string is a suffix - 'Liberal Party of Whatevs are booming,
# go trade illegal goods!'
