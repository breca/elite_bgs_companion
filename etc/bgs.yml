# BGS report formatting
#
# Here you can configure how your report string is formatted when it gets copied to the clipboard.
# The default is...
# $value > $type > $faction > $station > $system
# Which would generate the following...
# 1,876,234 > Combat Bonds > Blah > Spacey Ring > Sol
# NOTE: If you want to use a literal '$' in your string, use '$$' instead.
bgs_string: $value > $type > $faction > $station > $system

# "Types" allows you to change how the transaction types are presented.
# Each list/array element is appended to the first entry
# At least one line must be present
#
# For example, if you wanted to make this less verbose, you could remove the
# '$transactions' line.
